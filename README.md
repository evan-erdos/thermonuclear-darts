Let's Play Global Thermonuclear Lawn Darts.
Developed by [Deus Deceptor][site].

## Getting Started ##
This is a game designed specifically for the HTC Vive. 
You can read more about the system requirements and the Vive on our [wiki][].

### Installing ###
You'll need to set up your Vive as you normally do, 
and you'll need to download the appropriate version of the game for your system.

## Changelog ##
### [v0.2.0-alpha][] ###
- refined dart throw, added different physics profiles for playtesting
- implemented "levels", e.g., different cityscapes to throw darts at
- space station model finalized, now twice as large + more details!
- added a *sloppy* workaround for the perspective hack: 
  now the earth is **very** close to the station, and appears to be much "smaller"
- added tasty glowing, flickering CRT monitors, 
  displaying tasteful opcodes from the Apollo guidance computer
- virtual terrain now much larger, and now serves as the main game field
- much, much more!

### [v0.1.0-alpha][] ###
- migrated from GVR placeholders to Vive API
- rocket, lawn dart and station modeled, merged with main build
- basic aerodynamic effect applied to dart
- virtual terrain established, still work to do with blendshapes / levels
