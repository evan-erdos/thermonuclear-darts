### Getting Started ###
This is a VR game about spaceships designed specifically for the HTC Vive.
Check out the [Releases][] page to find a build for your system.

### Installing ###
Unfortunately, you will need an unreasonably powerful computer to play this game.
If you happen to have a Vive and a graphics card which spits hot fire,
you can go to the [Releases][] page and download the latest version.
If you do not happen to have a Vive and a graphics card which spits hot fire,
you can rest easy knowing that someday, if you work very hard for a very long time,
someday, maybe someday, you might own a computer that can run this game.

### Changelog ###

- added control panel, clicky butons, and master alarm

#### [v0.3.0-alpha][releases] ####

#### [v0.2.0-alpha][releases] ####
- refined dart throw, added different physics profiles for playtesting
- implemented "levels", e.g., different cityscapes to throw darts at
- space station model finalized, now twice as large + more details!
- added a *sloppy* workaround for the perspective hack:
  now the earth is *very* close to the station, and appears to be much "smaller"
- added crispy glowing, flickering CRT monitors,
  displaying tasteful opcodes from the Apollo guidance computer
- virtual terrain now much larger, and now serves as the main game field
- much, much more!
